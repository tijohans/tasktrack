# tasktrack 
This readme file serves as a quickstart for the developers of the application. 

## Project Overview

The tasktrack application is designed to help users organize their daily lives and improve their effectiveness in completing what needs to be done. What sets tasktrack apart from similar apps is its core feature of needing to take a photo to complete a task. 

### Key Features

The key features of this application is the ability to add and complete tasks while giving the user something to look back at with the completed tasks gallery. Currently, the application focuses only on the core functionality while simultaneously trying to provide a good user experience. 

## Local Development

To be able to view/work on the project locally, you'll need to set up a few things first.

### Prerequisites

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org)
* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable)
* [Xcode 15 ](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

### Recommended Visual Studio Code Plugins *( for developers )* 
* [Expo Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=expo.vscode-expo-tools)
* [React Native Tools](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.vscode-react-native)

 ### Clone the Project

The project can be run from any directory you want, so where you clone it is up to you.

```sh
cd ~/<your project dir>

git clone git@github.com:tijohans/tasktrack.git
```

After it has been cloned, install all dependencies using yarn.

```sh
cd tasktrack

yarn install
```

### Running the Application

**This part assumes you have already installed the simulator you want to use**

The app is configured with Expo. Expo makes it easy to simulate the application in both Android and iOS. To start the application, run the command beneath, and then press  Ôøº`A`Ôøº or Ôøº`I`Ôøº , depending on whether you want to run the Android or iOS simulation.

```sh
yarn start
```

It is also possible to directly open the simulator by running either:
```sh
yarn ios
# or
yarn android
```

## Documentation

### Code Style

Codestyle is enforced through our eslint config, which is already configured. You are encouraged to install an eslint-plugin for your chosen editor, for instance, [vscode-eslint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint) for Visual Studio Code. Configuring it to run `eslint --fix` on save can also be a good thing for productivity. Typescript is preferred, and it is set up in strict mode.

You can also lint the code manually from the project directory by running this command.

```sh
yarn run lint
```

## The File Structure
The React Native application follows a structured organization to maintain code clarity and separation of concerns. Here's a brief overview of the essential directories in which we will work:

**üìÅ src**
This directory contains most of the application's source code.
* components: Reusable UI components that are used throughout the app.
* utils: Helper functions, utility classes, or modules used across the app.

**üìÅ app**
The ‚Äúapp‚Äù directory contains the navigation of the application. We use file-based routing, simplifying navigation by associating each screen with a specific JavaScript file, making locating and managing screens directly through their respective files easy.

**üìÅ assets**
Static assets like images, fonts, and other resources are stored here. They can be accessed and used throughout the app.

**üìÅ android** and **üìÅ ios**
Platform-specific code and configurations for Android and iOS respectively. You might not need to modify these often, but they are essential for configuring platform-specific settings.
